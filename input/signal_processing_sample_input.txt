As previously mentioned, signal processing condenses measurements to extract information about some distant state of nature. Signal processing can be described from different perspectives. To an acoustician, it is a tool to turn measured signals into useful information. To a sonar designer, it is one part of a sonar system. To an electrical engineer, it is often restricted to digitization, sampling, filtering, and spectral estimation. A modern underwater acoustic signal processing system can include the following.
Although measurements are typically acquired jointly in space and time, signal processing is usually partitioned to combine signals across space first and then time. The other components are similarly separable, in part owing to their inherent modularity and also from a paced evolution in computational power. For example, early deployment of beamformers required special hardware so only beam-output data were easily accessible for analysis. Easy access to data enabled advances in the modern signal processing components of detection, classification, localization, and tracking.
A broader view of modern signal processing can be found by considering its theoretical foundations, which come from mathematical statistics. Almost all underwater acoustics applications can be categorized as statistical inference, which is comprised of estimation and hypothesis testing [2]. These two branches of statistical inference provide the mathematical framework and tools to derive or design signal processing algorithms extracting the desired information. Examples of point estimation include inferring depth via the depth sounder, internal-wave amplitude, or location of a mine on the seafloor. Hypothesis testing is itself a type of estimation where the state of nature is represented as a finite set (e.g., types of mines or marine mammal vocalizations). The most common is the binary hypothesis test known as a signal detection problem, for which the state of nature is the presence or absence of an object, phenomenon, or condition. For example, is there a fish school present or not? Is there a communications signal in the measurement or not? Are internal waves present or not? Most underwater acoustics applications combine both detection and estimation: is there a fish school and if so what type are they and how many fish are there in the school.
Each of the signal processing components in the above-mentioned list (perhaps excluding digitization) can be derived through either a detection or estimation paradigm. The importance of casting signal processing as a detection or estimation problem comes from the structured design approaches available within the field of mathematical statistics. The design approaches provide a means for algorithm derivation and dictate when and what optimality criteria are satisfied or if the resulting algorithm is suboptimal. For example, the losses incurred in performing the signal processing operations sequentially as opposed to in a unified manner can be evaluated or unified algorithms can be derived (e.g., see Ref. [3] for combined beamforming and tracking).
Signal processing has always been a critical aspect in spectroscopy and especially in FTS. The generalized use of computers as components in spectrometers to implement the Fourier transform and/or other digital signal processing (DSP) tasks requires, as a first step, that the signals used be discrete amplitude, discrete time-sampled representations of continuous amplitude, continuous time (analogue) signals, such as the output of a detector. The sampling process must meet certain minimum requirements for the resulting sample sequence to contain all the information of the original signal. The output of the sampling process is a continuous amplitude, discrete time representation of the original signal. To obtain a discrete amplitude sequence, the amplitude of each sample is quantized with finite precision by a digital to analogue converter (ADC) and is then represented by a number. The resulting sequence of numbers is the input to the DSP.
The signal processing approach to geometry processing was first introduced in the seminal work (Taubin, 1995), generalizing classical discrete Fourier analysis to discrete surface signal analysis. Prior to the popularity of the cotangent Laplacian, the uniform Laplacian (Tutte Laplacian) or combinatorial Laplacian (Zhang, 2004) was used instead. The uniform Laplacian (Taubin, 1995) is a graph Laplacian with uniform weights:

The generalized use of computers as components in spectrometers to implement the Fourier transform and/or other digital signal processing (DSP) tasks requires, as a first step, that the signals used be discrete amplitude, discrete time-sampled representations of continuous amplitude, continuous time (analogue) signals, such as the output of a detector. The sampling process must meet certain minimum requirements for the resulting sample sequence to contain all the information of the original signal. The output of the sampling process is a continuous amplitude, discrete time representation of the original signal. To obtain a discrete amplitude sequence, the amplitude of each sample is quantized with finite precision by a digital to analogue converter (ADC) and is then represented by a number. The resulting sequence of numbers is the input to the DSP.
The signal processing approach to geometry processing was first introduced in the seminal work (Taubin, 1995), generalizing classical discrete Fourier analysis to discrete surface signal analysis. Prior to the popularity of the cotangent Laplacian, the uniform Laplacian (Tutte Laplacian) or combinatorial Laplacian (Zhang, 2004) was used instead. The uniform Laplacian (Taubin, 1995) is a graph Laplacian with uniform weights:

Signal processing can be described from different perspectives. To an acoustician, it is a tool to turn measured signals into useful information. To a sonar designer, it is one part of a sonar system. To an electrical engineer, it is often restricted to digitization, sampling, filtering, and spectral estimation. A modern underwater acoustic signal processing system can include the following.
Although measurements are typically acquired jointly in space and time, signal processing is usually partitioned to combine signals across space first and then time. The other components are similarly separable, in part owing to their inherent modularity and also from a paced evolution in computational power. For example, early deployment of beamformers required special hardware so only beam-output data were easily accessible for analysis. Easy access to data enabled advances in the modern signal processing components of detection, classification, localization, and tracking.
A broader view of modern signal processing can be found by considering its theoretical foundations, which come from mathematical statistics. Almost all underwater acoustics applications can be categorized as statistical inference, which is comprised of estimation and hypothesis testing [2]. These two branches of statistical inference provide the mathematical framework and tools to derive or design signal processing algorithms extracting the desired information. Examples of point estimation include inferring depth via the depth sounder, internal-wave amplitude, or location of a mine on the seafloor. Hypothesis testing is itself a type of estimation where the state of nature is represented as a finite set (e.g., types of mines or marine mammal vocalizations). The most common is the binary hypothesis test known as a signal detection problem, for which the state of nature is the presence or absence of an object, phenomenon, or condition. For example, is there a fish school present or not? Is there a communications signal in the measurement or not? Are internal waves present or not? Most underwater acoustics applications combine both detection and estimation: is there a fish school and if so what type are they and how many fish are there in the school.
Each of the signal processing components in the above-mentioned list (perhaps excluding digitization) can be derived through either a detection or estimation paradigm. The importance of casting signal processing as a detection or estimation problem comes from the structured design approaches available within the field of mathematical statistics. The design approaches provide a means for algorithm derivation and dictate when and what optimality criteria are satisfied or if the resulting algorithm is suboptimal. For example, the losses incurred in performing the signal processing operations sequentially as opposed to in a unified manner can be evaluated or unified algorithms can be derived (e.g., see Ref. [3] for combined beamforming and tracking).

Signal processing can be described from different perspectives. To an acoustician, it is a tool to turn measured signals into useful information. To a sonar designer, it is one part of a sonar system. To an electrical engineer, it is often restricted to digitization, sampling, filtering, and spectral estimation. A modern underwater acoustic signal processing system can include the following.
Although measurements are typically acquired jointly in space and time, signal processing is usually partitioned to combine signals across space first and then time. The other components are similarly separable, in part owing to their inherent modularity and also from a paced evolution in computational power. For example, early deployment of beamformers required special hardware so only beam-output data were easily accessible for analysis. Easy access to data enabled advances in the modern signal processing components of detection, classification, localization, and tracking.
A broader view of modern signal processing can be found by considering its theoretical foundations, which come from mathematical statistics. Almost all underwater acoustics applications can be categorized as statistical inference, which is comprised of estimation and hypothesis testing [2]. These two branches of statistical inference provide the mathematical framework and tools to derive or design signal processing algorithms extracting the desired information. Examples of point estimation include inferring depth via the depth sounder, internal-wave amplitude, or location of a mine on the seafloor. Hypothesis testing is itself a type of estimation where the state of nature is represented as a finite set (e.g., types of mines or marine mammal vocalizations). The most common is the binary hypothesis test known as a signal detection problem, for which the state of nature is the presence or absence of an object, phenomenon, or condition. For example, is there a fish school present or not? Is there a communications signal in the measurement or not? Are internal waves present or not? Most underwater acoustics applications combine both detection and estimation: is there a fish school and if so what type are they and how many fish are there in the school.
Each of the signal processing components in the above-mentioned list (perhaps excluding digitization) can be derived through either a detection or estimation paradigm. The importance of casting signal processing as a detection or estimation problem comes from the structured design approaches available within the field of mathematical statistics. The design approaches provide a means for algorithm derivation and dictate when and what optimality criteria are satisfied or if the resulting algorithm is suboptimal. For example, the losses incurred in performing the signal processing operations sequentially as opposed to in a unified manner can be evaluated or unified algorithms can be derived (e.g., see Ref. [3] for combined beamforming and tracking).
Signal processing has always been a critical aspect in spectroscopy and especially in FTS. The generalized use of computers as components in spectrometers to implement the Fourier transform and/or other digital signal processing (DSP) tasks requires, as a first step, that the signals used be discrete amplitude, discrete time-sampled representations of continuous amplitude, continuous time (analogue) signals, such as the output of a detector. The sampling process must meet certain minimum requirements for the resulting sample sequence to contain all the information of the original signal. The output of the sampling process is a continuous amplitude, discrete time representation of the original signal. To obtain a discrete amplitude sequence, the amplitude of each sample is quantized with finite precision by a digital to analogue converter (ADC) and is then represented by a number. The resulting sequence of numbers is the input to the DSP.
The signal processing approach to geometry processing was first introduced in the seminal work (Taubin, 1995), generalizing classical discrete Fourier analysis to discrete surface signal analysis. Prior to the popularity of the cotangent Laplacian, the uniform Laplacian (Tutte Laplacian) or combinatorial Laplacian (Zhang, 2004) was used instead. The uniform Laplacian (Taubin, 1995) is a graph Laplacian with uniform weights:

Signal processing can be described from different perspectives. To an acoustician, it is a tool to turn measured signals into useful information. To a sonar designer, it is one part of a sonar system. To an electrical engineer, it is often restricted to digitization, sampling, filtering, and spectral estimation. A modern underwater acoustic signal processing system can include the following.
Although measurements are typically acquired jointly in space and time, signal processing is usually partitioned to combine signals across space first and then time. The other components are similarly separable, in part owing to their inherent modularity and also from a paced evolution in computational power. For example, early deployment of beamformers required special hardware so only beam-output data were easily accessible for analysis. Easy access to data enabled advances in the modern signal processing components of detection, classification, localization, and tracking.
A broader view of modern signal processing can be found by considering its theoretical foundations, which come from mathematical statistics. Almost all underwater acoustics applications can be categorized as statistical inference, which is comprised of estimation and hypothesis testing [2]. These two branches of statistical inference provide the mathematical framework and tools to derive or design signal processing algorithms extracting the desired information. Examples of point estimation include inferring depth via the depth sounder, internal-wave amplitude, or location of a mine on the seafloor. Hypothesis testing is itself a type of estimation where the state of nature is represented as a finite set (e.g., types of mines or marine mammal vocalizations). The most common is the binary hypothesis test known as a signal detection problem, for which the state of nature is the presence or absence of an object, phenomenon, or condition. For example, is there a fish school present or not? Is there a communications signal in the measurement or not? Are internal waves present or not? Most underwater acoustics applications combine both detection and estimation: is there a fish school and if so what type are they and how many fish are there in the school.
Each of the signal processing components in the above-mentioned list (perhaps excluding digitization) can be derived through either a detection or estimation paradigm. The importance of casting signal processing as a detection or estimation problem comes from the structured design approaches available within the field of mathematical statistics. The design approaches provide a means for algorithm derivation and dictate when and what optimality criteria are satisfied or if the resulting algorithm is suboptimal. For example, the losses incurred in performing the signal processing operations sequentially as opposed to in a unified manner can be evaluated or unified algorithms can be derived (e.g., see Ref. [3] for combined beamforming and tracking).
Signal processing has always been a critical aspect in spectroscopy and especially in FTS. The generalized use of computers as components in spectrometers to implement the Fourier transform and/or other digital signal processing (DSP) tasks requires, as a first step, that the signals used be discrete amplitude, discrete time-sampled representations of continuous amplitude, continuous time (analogue) signals, such as the output of a detector. The sampling process must meet certain minimum requirements for the resulting sample sequence to contain all the information of the original signal. The output of the sampling process is a continuous amplitude, discrete time representation of the original signal. To obtain a discrete amplitude sequence, the amplitude of each sample is quantized with finite precision by a digital to analogue converter (ADC) and is then represented by a number. The resulting sequence of numbers is the input to the DSP.
The signal processing approach to geometry processing was first introduced in the seminal work (Taubin, 1995), generalizing classical discrete Fourier analysis to discrete surface signal analysis. Prior to the popularity of the cotangent Laplacian, the uniform Laplacian (Tutte Laplacian) or combinatorial Laplacian (Zhang, 2004) was used instead. The uniform Laplacian (Taubin, 1995) is a graph Laplacian with uniform weights:
